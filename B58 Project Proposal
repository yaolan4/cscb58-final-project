Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Allergic to Bees

Project Description: Player moves on screen while avoiding incresing number of moving objects and tries to stay alive as long as possible.
-joystick to move character
-VGA board to show game screen
-decreasing counter whenever the person dies, or increasing when they get a (life) consumable
-randomly bouncng objects, like in pong but number increasing as time passes
-counter for time alive, which increases number of obstacles on screen
-consumables that may have effects on player, such as extra life, increased speed, etc

Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
Look through attributed code to get an idea of how to implement certain features, then work out how to implement a joystick and obstacles (make them bounce and keep adding and different speed) and make a FSM for the game.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
Implement counters for lives and timer, make character die when lives are zero

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
Add comsumable objects to increase/decrease speed of obstacles or to get/lose life. If there is time, make it two players.

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
If obstacles don't bounce, we make them cross the screen.
If joystick does not work, use keys or buttons.
If there is not enough time, ignore consumbles or extra player.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board
(be sure to e-mail Brian if itâ€™s anything beyond the basics to make sure there's enough to go around)
Joystick

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
Counters: lives and timer;
VGA board: for visuals;
FSM: for controlling the whole thing

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):

Why did you personally choose this project?:clkBall

Updates
-------

Week 1: We tested the external joystick, and had to used the breadboard to connect it up to the FPGA, with some trial and error.
Considering this was the first time we did anything more electrical than flipping a switch, i'd say we did decently.
We also figured out how to make a character (currently just a square) move around the screen using keys (which we will replace
with the joystick now that we’ve figured it out), and also have prototyped the FSM in order to be able to clear the screen between 
movement properly. Unfortunately, due to lack of time we have not been able to test this out, but we do have time booked in the
makerspace before the next lab so we can get more progress made towards having working basic mechanics of the game.

Week 2: We revised our FSM for our control module and our datapath module to get our pixel to move using four
directions but with clearing its previous position. Also developed code so that we can utilize the joystick and eventually replace the keys on the board.
This took longer than expected so we were not able to add other bees. We plan to have modules for high score, other
bees on the screen, and collision detection. The high score will be time based on a rate divider and the goal of the player is to stay alive
as long as possible without getting hit by the bees. We will test this in the lab of week 3.
